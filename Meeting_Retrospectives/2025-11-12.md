# Meeting 2 – Development Progress Checkpoint

**Date:** 2025-11-12



---

## Agenda

The goal was to review microservice progress, resolve permission issues in AWS, and address early cloud cost concerns.

---

## Discussion

The uploader service successfully generated S3 pre-signed URLs.

The processor service was able to poll messages from SQS, and a placeholder thumbnail generator was added.

The analytics service could aggregate views and likes.

Frontend development had started, including dashboard layout and basic API integration.

The team validated the EKS cluster, ensured nodes were provisioned correctly, and deployed initial pods. During this, they discovered high NAT Gateway and node costs and discussed ways to minimize them.

---

## Decisions

- The team agreed to rely on EKS multi-AZ architecture.
- Consolidate secrets into Kubernetes Secrets.
- Postpone cluster autoscaling until the final testing phase.

---

## Action Items

- Members continued resolving IAM role issues.
- Improving frontend functionality.
- Integrating GitHub Actions for ECR image building.

## Retrospective

###  What Went Well
- **Service Progress**: All core services (uploader, processor, analytics) showed tangible progress with working features.
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Successfully validated EKS cluster and node provisioning, confirming the architecture works.
- **Cost Awareness**: Early identification of high AWS costs (NAT Gateway, nodes) allowed the team to address them proactively.
- **Frontend Integration**: Basic API integration started, showing the system coming together.

###  What Could Be Improved
- **Cost Planning**: Should have estimated AWS costs before provisioning to avoid surprises. NAT Gateway costs ($32/month per AZ) and node costs could have been anticipated.
- **IAM Issues**: Permission problems suggest earlier setup of IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) would have saved time.
- **Documentation**: Could have documented the manual EKS setup process as it was being done to help with troubleshooting.

###  Lessons Learned
- **AWS Costs Add Up Quickly**: NAT Gateways and EKS nodes are expensive. Always monitor costs and scale down when not in use.
- **Early Infrastructure Setup**: Setting up IAM roles and permissions early prevents blocking issues later.
- **Incremental Progress**: Seeing each service work independently before integration builds confidence.

### Action Items for Next Meeting
- Complete IAM role configuration for all services.
- Implement cost-saving measures (scale down nodes when idle).
- Complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
- Test end-to-end workflow integration.
