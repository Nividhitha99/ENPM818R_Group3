#  Meeting 1 – Initial Planning & Architecture

**Date:** 2025-11-06


---

## Agenda

The team met to understand the project requirements, align on deliverables, and decide on a cloud-native architecture.

---

## Discussion

During this session, the group agreed to create Video-Analytics Dashboard on  AWS EKS as the deployment platform and adopt a microservices architecture consisting of the uploader, processor, analytics, and frontend services. The data pipeline was defined as: S3 upload → SQS queue → processor service → analytics storage → frontend dashboard.

The tech stack was finalized (Python/NodeJS for backend and React for frontend), and decisions were made regarding GitHub repository structure, branch naming conventions, and project workflow. The team also discussed Terraform vs manual provisioning and chose manual EKS creation due to time constraints.

---

## Decisions

- Everyone would work on separate branches and use PR-based workflow.
- GitHub Projects would be used for task management.

---

## Action Items

- The repository and project folder structure would be set up next.
- Members would begin creating microservice skeletons.

## Retrospective

###  What Went Well
- **Clear Architecture Vision**: The team quickly aligned on a microservices architecture with well-defined service boundaries (uploader, processor, analytics, frontend).
- **Technology Stack Consensus**: Fast agreement on AWS EKS, Python/FastAPI for backend, and React for frontend reduced decision paralysis.
- **Workflow Definition**: Establishing PR-based workflow and GitHub Projects early set a good foundation for collaboration.
- **Pipeline Clarity**: Defining the data flow (S3 → SQS → Processor → Analytics → Frontend) early helped everyone understand the system.

### What Could Be Improved
- **Terraform vs Manual**: Choosing manual EKS creation due to time constraints was pragmatic but may have led to less reproducible infrastructure. Consider documenting manual steps for future reference.
- **Service Communication**: Could have defined API contracts and service interfaces earlier to reduce integration issues later.
- **Cost Planning**: Should have discussed AWS cost estimates and budget constraints upfront to avoid surprises.

###  Lessons Learned
- **Early Architecture Decisions Matter**: Getting alignment on architecture early prevented rework later.
- **Balance Speed vs Best Practices**: Sometimes pragmatic decisions (manual provisioning) are necessary, but document them well.
- **Clear Communication**: Having all members present for initial planning ensured everyone understood the vision.

###  Action Items for Next Meeting
- Review microservice skeletons and ensure consistent structure.
- Define API contracts between services.
- Set up initial AWS resources and document access procedures.
