# Meeting 4 – Final Review & Documentation

**Date:** 2025-12-02



---

## Agenda

The objective of this meeting was to validate all deployment components, complete documentation, and prepare for final submission.

---

## Discussion

The group verified that all microservices ran correctly when node groups scaled to one instance. Screenshots were collected for EKS deployments, pods, services, S3 buckets, SQS queues, CI/CD runs, linting checks, and analytics. The contribution graph was reviewed to ensure visible activity.

Meeting notes and retrospectives were drafted, and the team validated that AWS spending was under control by shutting down compute resources when not in use.

---

## Decisions

- Development was frozen, and only documentation edits were permitted.
- The team planned to record the demo video the same day.
- Archive unused AWS resources after submission.

---

## Action Items

- Members would upload all final screenshots.
- Complete the documentation.
- Submit the project.

## Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **System Validation**: Successfully verified all microservices work correctly with minimal resources (one node instance), proving the system is production-ready.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Collected all necessary screenshots covering deployments, infrastructure, CI/CD, and analytics.
- **Cost Control**: Final validation showed AWS spending was under control, demonstrating good cloud resource management.
- **Team Coordination**: Freezing development and focusing on documentation shows good project discipline.

### What Could Be Improved
- **Earlier Documentation**: Some documentation work could have been done incrementally throughout the project rather than at the end.
- **Demo Preparation**: Could have prepared demo script and tested recording earlier to avoid last-minute issues.
- **Resource Cleanup Plan**: Should have documented the cleanup process earlier to ensure nothing is forgotten.

### Lessons Learned
- **Documentation as You Go**: Writing documentation incrementally is easier than doing it all at the end.
- **Resource Efficiency**: The system works well with minimal resources, showing good scalability design.
- **Project Discipline**: Freezing development and focusing on final deliverables prevents scope creep.
- **Cost Awareness**: Continuous monitoring and management of AWS costs is essential for cloud projects.

### Final Takeaways
- **Architecture Success**: The microservices architecture with EKS, S3, and SQS proved to be a solid choice.
- **Team Collaboration**: PR-based workflow and GitHub Projects facilitated good collaboration.
- **Cloud Best Practices**: Learned valuable lessons about AWS cost management and resource optimization.
- **Project Completion**: Successfully delivered a working cloud-native video analytics platform.

### Future Improvements
- 
- Implement automated testing earlier in the development cycle.
- Set up monitoring and alerting from the start.
- Create staging environment for safer deployments.
