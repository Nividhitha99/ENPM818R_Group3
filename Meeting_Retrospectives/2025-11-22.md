# Meeting 3 – Testing & Cost Optimization

**Date:** 2025-11-22

**Attendees:** All members

---

## Agenda

The aim was to test the entire workflow end-to-end and optimize AWS costs before the submission period.

---

## Discussion

The complete flow—uploading a video, processing it through S3 and SQS, generating a thumbnail, updating analytics, and showing results on the frontend—was successfully validated. The team noticed that node groups were generating high AWS charges, so they agreed to scale node groups down to zero when the cluster was idle.

Frontend successfully displayed video thumbnails, showed playable video, and recorded likes and view counts. Pre-commit hooks were configured, and formatting was standardized across the repository.

---

## Decisions

- The team disabled YAML lint checks for the Kubernetes folder since multi-document YAML was required.
- CODEOWNERS and CONTRIBUTING.md were added.
- PR protection rules were enabled.

---

## Action Items

- Everyone continued preparing screenshots required for the report.
- Managing AWS costs daily by scaling down node groups outside testing sessions.

## Retrospective

###  What Went Well
- **End-to-End Success**: The complete workflow validation (upload → process → analytics → frontend) confirmed the architecture works as designed.
- **Cost Management**: Proactive approach to scaling down node groups when idle shows good cloud cost discipline.
- **Code Quality**: Implementing pre-commit hooks and standardizing formatting improved code consistency.
- **Frontend Functionality**: Video playback, thumbnails, and analytics display working end-to-end demonstrates solid integration.

###  What Could Be Improved
- **Cost Optimization Timing**: Should have implemented cost-saving measures (scaling down nodes) earlier in the project lifecycle.
- **Testing Strategy**: Could have done more incremental integration testing earlier to catch issues sooner.
- **Documentation**: While CODEOWNERS and CONTRIBUTING.md were added, could have documented the cost optimization process for future reference.

###  Lessons Learned
- **Test Early, Test Often**: End-to-end testing validated the system but could have been done incrementally.
- **Cloud Cost Discipline**: Always scale down resources when not in use. AWS costs can spiral quickly.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Pre-commit hooks and formatting standards prevent style issues from accumulating.
- **YAML Linting**: Sometimes tooling needs to be adjusted for project-specific requirements (multi-doc YAML).

###  Action Items for Next Meeting
- Complete all required screenshots for documentation.
- Finalize documentation (SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, etc.).
- Prepare demo video.
- Plan resource cleanup after submission.
